#Welcome;Welcome to the interactive tour for <code>assessr</code>!
#DT_abstracts;The main part is occupied here by the main DataTable, where all abstracts are displayed.
#submissionType + .selectize-control; Selecting the type of submission, you can choose if you are going to review Workshops or Talks and other contributions type (posters, shiny demos)
#reviewer + .selectize-control; Use this selector to filter only the abstract which are assigned  to you. Remember that you must review all the submissions assigned to you, but if you want, you can review also other submissions  
#cols_abstract + .selectize-control; Clicking on the elements in this selectize widget, you can edit its looks, by adding/removing/sorting the columns you display - you might want to use a minimal configuration, for example.
#DT_abstracts;If you changed something in the previous widget, see how the aspect of the DT changes.
#DT_abstracts;You can drill down the content of each abstract by clicking on any row of the DT table. Please do so before proceeding.
#session_abstract;See how the content of each contribution are beautified and displayed in the right column of the app
#launch_gform;Importantly: once you are ready to evaluate the contributed session, here's a comfy link for you to evaluate it in the Google Form for this. 
#launch_gform;If you click on this, this has a nice side effect: the Id of the contributed session is copied directly to the clipboard, so you can paste it in the Form
#session_abstract;That's pretty much it. Please remember to evaluate all the contributed sessions you are assigned to, and of course to fill in the complete set of info in the evaluation form.
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the tour of <code>assessr</code>!
